# What is this
This is a custom UI library for C# in an aseprite-inspired but distinct enough visual style. It is primarily developed for personal use so it isn't as robust as major frameworks and may have some quirks i'm used to that you may find weird.
You are welcome to use it and provide feedback nontheless.

Documentation pending.
